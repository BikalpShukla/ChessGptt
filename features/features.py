# There are many functions, each extracting a specific chess feature, such as:

# Material: Counts the total value of pieces for each side.
# Mobility: Number of legal moves.
# King Safety: Evaluates if the king is safe or exposed.
# Pawn Structure: Finds doubled, isolated, and passed pawns.
# Center Control: How many central squares are controlled.
# Development: Number of developed minor pieces.
# Rook Activity: Rooks on open files.
# Threats: Hanging (undefended and attacked) pieces.
# Piece Activity: Number of legal moves for each color.
# Piece Coordination: Number of defended pieces.
# Bishop Pair Bonus: Checks if both bishops are present.
# Open File Control: Rooks/queens on open files.
# Space Advantage: Controlled squares in opponent's half.
# Weak Squares: Central squares not controlled.
# Outposts: Safe squares for knights in enemy territory.
# Pinned Pieces: Number of pinned pieces.
# Attacked vs Defended: Balance of attacked and defended squares.
# Castling Status: Whether castling rights are available.
# King Zone Control: Controlled squares around the king.
# Rook on 7th Rank: Rooks on the 7th rank.
# Connected Rooks: If rooks support each other.
# Passed Pawn Advancement: How far passed pawns have advanced.
# Pawn Shield: Pawns protecting the king.
# Backward Pawns: Pawns with no support from behind.
# Isolated Weakness Clusters: Groups of isolated pawns.
